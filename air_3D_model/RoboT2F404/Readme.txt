Before printing all the parts you should print the CALIBRATOR, to check if your parts will fit together. If you have a very hard time putting those parts together, adjusting the horizontal expansion setting of your slicer software can solve that, this setting can vary depending of your slicer and printer but users report to set it at -0.15 is a great place to start.

An infill of 30%, wall thickness 2.5mm, best with no raft, no support(unless specified), use a brim on big parts to avoid warping.

The size of the molds are big and require a big print area. Check if it fits your printer prior starting building the head. Standard 220x220mm bed size will do the job. I printed mine at 0.4mm because a primer filler is then applied on all surfaces. I am using Upol UHS high build Primer S 2021 G/I with it’s fast hardener S 2021/I. You can use Primer filler in spray can, make a test to check if the silicone reacts well against the primer you found.

The silicon reference is Smooth-On Ecoflex 00-10. One skin requires about 500/600Gr. You can color silicon with oil paint or pigments. You can also add flocking to give it a skin touch. Because skin color is very light and slightly transparent, you only need to add a very little amount. Mainly white, then some red and a tiny bit of yellow.

Print with an infill of 30%, wall thickness 2mm, check for parts that needs support.

Here is the list of parts and the number of prints needed for the mold, select Male or Female:
1x InnerMiddleMold
1x InnerSidesMold
1x OuterBottomMoldFemale (add support)
1x OuterBottomMoldMale (add support)
1x OuterTopMoldFemale (add support)
1x OuterTopMoldMale (add support)
Print with an infill of 15%, wall thickness 2mm, check for parts that needs support.

I printed mine at 0.4mm and used an old BFB 3D printer, this is the reason my mold looks awful, but then I applied sprayed car filler plus some sanding and finished with a clean car filler spray. Even if your prints looks clean, you should use car filler. Silicone is so thin, it can pass through the surfaces of your prints. As a result you wouldn’t have enough of 500/600Gr of silicone.

The three inner molds should not be glued or attached to each other, otherwise you will not be able to release the skin and inner molds from the outer molds.
The purpose of the angled middle inner mold is to be able to slide out easier once the silicone is cured.
