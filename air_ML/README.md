# AIR: Artificially Intelligent Robot & Personal Assistant

## Project Overview

**AIR (Artificially Intelligent Robot)** is a cutting-edge humanoid robot designed to closely emulate human features and behaviors. Serving as a personal assistant and social influencer, AIR combines advanced capabilities in vision, auditory processing, memory retention, language processing, and automation, providing an intuitive, interactive experience.

## Features & Requirements

AIR has been designed with a comprehensive set of features, aimed at enhancing interaction, assistance, and automation for users. Here’s an outline of AIR’s high-level capabilities:

### Appearance & Physical Structure
- **Human-like Appearance** with realistic facial features and mouth movements synchronized with speech.
- **Facial Expressions** that dynamically adjust during conversation.

### Vision System (Eyes)
- **Face Recognition** and **Registration**.
- **Motion Detection** and **Spatial Awareness** of surroundings.
- **Emotional Analysis** for nuanced responses.

### Auditory System (Ears)
- **Sound Source Localization** with dual microphones.
- **Selective Attention** to relevant sound sources, avoiding false positives.

### Communication & Expression
- **Speech Output** with synchronized mouth movement.
- **Multilingual Support** for diverse languages and accents.

### Cognitive Abilities (Brain)
- **Spatial Memory** of the environment.
- **People Recognition** with categorization by attributes like gender, age, and interaction history.
- **Personalized Learning** through reinforcement learning and custom data training.

### Social Media & Communication
- **Social Media Presence** on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Instagram.
- **Data Automation** and **Messaging Assistance** (e.g., WhatsApp, emails).

### Personal Assistant Capabilities
- **Programming Assistance** both physically and remotely.
- **Alarm Setting**, **Scheduling**, and **Calendar Management**.

### Health & IoT Control
- **Health Data Management** for administrators with dietary suggestions.
- **IoT Home Appliance Control** for a connected home experience.
