Respect others
Many of our services allow your child to interact with other people that  
use our services. We want to maintain a respectful environment for  
everyone. This means your child must follow basic rules of conduct, such as  
not abusing or harming others or themselves (or threatening or encouraging  
such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming,  
bullying, harassing, stalking others, or by publicly distributing hateful  
content (such as content inciting hatred or discrimination on account of  
people's origin, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) when  
using our services. The publication of hateful content may expose you and  
your child to civil or criminal liability.
----------
Google services
AIR has the opportunity to use several Google services to improve their  
Android experience. These may include managing backups

AIR signed in on a new device
Hi Maaz Asghar,
AIR recently signed in to air.humanoid.robot@gmail.com using Chrome.
You may want to consider other ways to manage this device. Not all of  
Family Link’s parental controls work here. For example:
*Can apply:*
    - Activity controls and other Google Account settings apply only when  
AIR is signed in to their account. AIR can sign out at any time.
    - Website restrictions apply only when AIR is signed in to Chrome and  
browsing in Chrome with their account. They don’t apply if AIR is signed  
out or using a different browser.
*Won't apply:*
    - You won't be able to see the location of this device in Family Link.
    - App activity and screen time controls won’t apply to this device.
*Don’t recognize this activity?*
We take your child's security very seriously and want to keep you in the  
loop on important actions with their account. If something doesn’t seem  
right, a parent can always reset AIR's Google Account password  
<https://support.google.com/families?p=email_resetpassword> in Family Link  
to help protect it.
Best,
The Family Link team
